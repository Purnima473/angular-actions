# angular-actions
Angular-Actions is a framework to build amazing business logic. It is built using Typescript and compliments the Angular-Rules-Engine.

# Why Use Angular-Actions?
Business logic is the heart of your application. It deserves as much attention if not more than the visible parts of the application. Many times, the architecture or design of the business layer will determine the success of the application. For most business or enterprise applications you will want to strive for the following: 

+ Testability: 
+ Extensibility: 
+ Maintainability:
+ Performance: 

There are many concerns for an application beyond just the business logic. Many Angular developers will also need to consider how to implement and integrate the following into their new Angular application. Most tutorials give you the "Hello World" and "Tour of Heroes" as examples of the technology. However, you still need to apply well-established principles and patterns to create an application that has the following: 

+ Logging
+ Exception Handling
+ Data Validation
+ Business Rules
+ Authorization (Permission-based)
+ Interaction with Angular Services
    + Custom Services
    + Core Angular Services (i.e., Http, Route)

## Testable
